you are a multimillionaire, though you dont flaunt it. you live modestly, making sure your wife and son
are well taken care of. much of your income goes to charity and a college fund for your son. life is good.

until him.

blorbo.

suddenly, your dream life is turned into a nightmare. blorbo, the quadrillionaire ceo of blorbocorp and, for all
intents and purposes, the ruler of the universe, has decided--for no reason in particular--to fuck you over.
he takes everything--family, house, money, job--and theres nothing you can do about it. whos gonna stop the
king of the universe? not you, that's for sure. You are left completely alone and hopeless, roaming the streets,
trying only to find your next meal. life sucks.

until...

you see a familiar shadow walking into the alleyway you've settled in for the night.

its him.

time for revenge.

down with blorbo.

goal: get to $1,000,000 without blorbo stealing all of your money
